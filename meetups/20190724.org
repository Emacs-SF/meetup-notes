(Your Organizer's notes)
- his phone app is called drafts
- all captured stuff (via capture templates) goes into inbox
- captures /constantly/
- shift-tab changes visibility for entire file (collapse, then L1...)
- custom sorting function org-sort-all
- reviews the result in its entirety
- mark "defer" to remove from list of TODO and make it 6+ months away
- there is also "someday" which is very low priority
- some of the TODO items will get scheduled today or this week with C-c C-s
- he likes pair programming
- C-c a a to look at agenda
- a "deadline" should not be done after its date vs. a schedule which is a prompt
- each scheduled task is A, B, or C priority
- f in agenda view to move the task into the future
- m to mark then B f to bulk schedule in the future
- C-c a n makes a custom report showing the first TODO in every project
  - shows the "next action" a la GTD
- C-a h "hot projects" next actions list
  - probably more valuable than the schedule!
- C-c C-z to quickly add notes
  - easy historical log notes are a feature entirely missing from paid phone apps
  - helpful for following up with bureaucracies
- "meter" showing how far behind on work
- org-habit to track recurring tasks
  - each time it's marked "done" it comes back but remembers he did it
  - colors indicate the frequency of completion
  - helps with happy spouse

After this point we had questions and I had to pass around the microphone, so I didn't capture them...
