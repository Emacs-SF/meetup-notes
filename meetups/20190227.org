* Speaker: Sean Farley
** Introduction
- tutorial, basically
- all code on Bitbucket
  [[bitbucket.org/seanfarley/dotfiles]]
*** LSP
- Wanted completion in Emacs
- Previous stuff was ad hoc, wanted something unified
- saw George Pittarelli's presentation on LSP
*** New LSP
- recent big (breaking) refactoring
- kitchen sink included now instead of separate packages
- from Microsoft, but don't worry
*** Mercurial
- git alternative, written in Python
- speaker was/is a Mercurial developer
- tested code completion on the Mercurial codebase
- demand (lazy) importing got in the way
*** Demo
- looking at betterbib (some kind of BibTeX helper) code
*** Microsoft's python language server
- open source, on Github
- written in C#/.NET (!)
- MS very responsive on bugs
- someone made a LSP client for it: lsp-python-ms
*** dap-mode
- "Debug Adapter Protocol"
*** flycheck via flake8
- pep8 + pyflakes
*** autoformatter: black
- named for Henry Ford's famous quotation
- thus highly opinionated
*** projectile integration
Sean notes that [[https://github.com/pwalsh/pipenv.el][pipenv]] from Melpa has useful functionality here
*** Elpy comparison
- "no luck" in his projects
- LSP via MS worked much better for him, same features
*** Palantir has an LSP server for Python too
- but Sean likes MS better
- several in the audience note the ewww factor
