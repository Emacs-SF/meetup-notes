*** Jeff Trull: Retro Emacs
The Emacs manual says "The first Emacs was a set of macros written in 1976 at MIT by RMS for the editor TECO." 
In my talk I will explain what this means, what TECO is, and what the earliest versions of Emacs provided to its users. 
Many concepts in Emacs to this day derive from the needs of this early time; I will connect the solutions of that time to the architecture of today. 
There will also - hopefully - be a live demo of both TECO and Emacs circa 1980 on an emulated TOPS-20.
