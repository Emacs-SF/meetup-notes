#+TITLE: Jan 27 2021 discussion of emacs, org-mode, org-roam and similar packages
* Jan 27 2021 discussion of emacs, org-mode, org-roam and similar packages
** meetup chat (before meeting, condensed)
*** Mike Wright
Kicking off discussion of possible topics--here are some links to consider before meeting:
> https://github.com/the-ted/org-mind-map
> https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam
> https://github.com/Kungsgeten/org-brain
feel free to suggest others

** jitsi.org video call - Mike's meeting notes
*** Brian Wood
discussed org-mode and time tracking.
*** Mike Wright 
- discussion: consensus seems to be that org-roam is better documented/supported
than org-brain or org-mind-map (or just of more interest to this meeting's attendees).
Also, having online meeting attendee limits isn't really needed.
- sent online meeting URL to meetup.com chat for waitlist people, and lurkers :-)
- demo: (after 1 week of use) org-roam, [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-server][org-roam-server]], hierarchies, cross-linking, filtering view
- will schedule next online meetup for a Friday morning in February; topic: completion packages
(no attendee limits)
*** Ag Ibragimov
- demo: (after 2 weeks of use) org-roam, org-roam-server, capture templates, backlinks, daily notes, db clearing/rebuilding
- book discussion: Smart Note Taking
- [[https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B06WVYW33Y/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1][How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking â€“ for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers]]
- [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/blob/master/org-roam-protocol.el][org-roam protocol]] e.g., to edit local files linked-to from org-roam-server graph display in browser
- capture text from browser into org-roam
- commercial alternative to org-roam: [[https://obsidian.md/][obsidian.md]]
*** Ezequiel Birman
- uses Roam for work, obsidian.md for personal use
*** Jeff Trull
- ein [[https://millejoh.github.io/emacs-ipython-notebook/][Emacs IPython Notebook]]
*** Sacha Chua 

- demo: transcript editing for EmacsConf
- mentioned a new thing: code-cells related to Jupyter Notebooks.
*** Garav Jain
- gkroam
*** Ethan Edwards
- demo'ed using org-roam to organize comics
*** others
- [[https://foambubble.github.io/foam/][Foam]] is a personal knowledge management and sharing system inspired by Roam Research, built on Visual Studio Code and GitHub.

Hi, just came in! Still finishing dinner but definitely listening
There is such a thing like oral tradition but it is true that for me too, I can deal better with the world around me if I keep a written record
18:46
Ian
Hi everybody, just observing tonight, glad to be able to hear these presentations.
18:54
Ethan
My dad uses obsidian
18:54
Pierce Wang
yeah! I've recommended Obsidian to my parents (they don't use Emacs unfortunately)
18:54
Ag
obsidian.md
18:54
Pierce Wang
that and Roam Research as well
18:55
Ethan
My dad has to use Roam for his job, but obsidian for personal use.
18:55
Ezequiel Birman
For propietary software maybe second brain and Roam Research, The Glamorous Toolkit, although solving a broader problem, is MIT licensed. Whatabout Codex?
yup
18:58
Pierce Wang
Would anyone here happen to have seen some of the EmacsConf2020 talks by Leo Vivier? he's a co-maintainer of org-roam and he had a couple talks about org files and org-roam
18:59
Ethan
The archives are probably on youtube
18:59
Pierce Wang
on the EmacsConf website! all there
18:59
Ethan
oh, there too  ðŸ˜ƒ
18:59
yes, I viewed some org-roam videos on youtube by Leo

Jeff Trull
Now I understand why a favorite dish from a local French place is "Hachis Parmentier"
19:03
Ezequiel Birman
I tried a few org-protocol plug-ins a few years ago but at that time they were kind of broken. I should try again.
beautiful
19:05
Ethan
Yeah, that's really cool, I had no idea you could do that
19:06
Pierce Wang
^! I'll definitely be checking out org-protocol
19:07
Ethan
Can you click on those?
19:08
Ezequiel Birman
it is an svg, i guess not
19:08
Jeff Trull
No, it's graphviz I think
Might be able to improve its appearance though, with some extra control info
19:09
configure a different graphviz layout engine, like circo
19:09
Ezequiel Birman
How about exporting org-roam graph to a text based format like html or pdf? I mean in a non-graphical way
19:14
https://notes.alexkehayias.com/org-roam/
has exporting to html notes
19:18
Sacha Chua
https://github.com/zainab-ali/pair-tree.el
 has a clickable SVG for visualizing cons cells. Somebody should make something like that for mindmapping Org Mode files =)
19:18
Pierce Wang
Sacha! Hello!
19:19
Sacha Chua
Hello Pierce, all!
19:19
Jeff Trull
Hi Sacha, we were in the same meetups today ðŸ˜ƒ
19:19
Salar Rahmanian
which other meetups? ðŸ˜ƒ
19:20
Sacha Chua
Jeff: I'm guiltlessly sneaking into this one thanks to the link from the meetup comments. =)
19:20
Jeff Trull
Emacs Berlin!
19:20
Salar Rahmanian
nice
19:20
Jeff Trull
There was one in Singapore too supposedly
19:20
Sacha Chua
I've been keeping a list of upcoming meetups at 
https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Usergroups
 and 
https://emacslife.com/calendar/
and they're now the first heading in Emacs News
19:21
Salar Rahmanian
cool thanks
slightly off topic what is everyone using on their iphones to view and do some light editing of their org files?
19:22
Pierce Wang
ah beorg works pretty well for me! ^
19:22
Ethan
I found beorg yesterday, I've yet to download it and try it out though.
19:23
Salar Rahmanian
I tried it for a day and didn't take to it, maybe I should try again
19:23
Pierce Wang
for less task-centric things, though, organice is pretty good too I think
19:23
Ethan
I never got organice to work
19:23
Ezequiel Birman
I just rememebered the existence of 
https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/hode
19:23
Greg Coladonato
Yes! Anki!!
19:24
Sacha Chua
I remember the Remembrance Agent, which looked at the 100 words or so around your cursor and suggested stuff that was relevant. That would be pretty neat too. =)
I hear sometimes people keep index nodes that link to a bunch of other nodes to make things a little easier to find
19:31
Pierce Wang
thanks for this event everyone! sorry I have to head out early--have to head to a recording session tonight. Looking forward to the next one!
19:33
Ethan
Socrates
Random topic ^ heh
19:37
Sacha Chua
Hmm... I should figure out a workflow for taking my Android share -> Orgzly 
inbox.org
 -> Syncthing stuff into org-roam.
19:39
Greg Coladonato
Hey Ag, where could i find out more about how to connect If This Then That to save a link to every youtube video I like to a file on the web?
OK have to jump. Thanks for the presentation!
19:45
Ezequiel Birman
Thanks for your presentation

Ezequiel Birman
Does anyone know what is 
https://twitter.com/AthensResearch
 about?
19:55
Ag
@iLemming
19:55
Ezequiel Birman
They have a discord but all those greek names confuse me
YES it was me
I mean, about ADHD
19:56
Sacha Chua
I've seen a few people posting their Zettelkasten slipboxes online. 
https://doubleloop.net/2020/08/21/how-publish-org-roam-wiki-org-publish/
 looks interesting.
19:56
Jeff Trull
That was a really good conversation Ezequiel, it triggered a lot of thoughts
19:57
Ezequiel Birman
Sometimes I feel like I need a third brain
19:57
Sacha Chua
Baader-Meinhof phenomenon
19:59
Ezequiel Birman
I am feeling the same. Everything now seems about knowledge representation
YES!
Thank you Sacha
19:59
Sacha Chua
I'm editing subtitles for EmacsConf. =)
Want to see?
20:04
Ezequiel Birman
Wow, thanks
20:04
Ag
Yah!
20:04
Sacha Chua
I'm starting to get the hang of writing helm sources =)
20:10
Jeff Trull
I fixed a bug in one! It was kind of scary ðŸ˜ƒ
What was the source you were making?
20:14
Sacha Chua
One for opening or linking to my sketches
20:15
Jeff Trull
oh neat
20:16
Sacha Chua
How can we help with spreading the word?
People tend to be reasonable at self-organizing
20:20
Ezequiel Birman
I am already muted ðŸ˜ƒ Maybe someone is willing to manage a Twitter account for this group?
20:20
Sacha Chua
so if it's getting to be too big, you could say, hey, hop onto a different meet if this is getting  too laggy
20:20
Ezequiel Birman
I am going to bed. Thank you all!
20:23
Jeff Trull
Goodnight!

There was another new thing: code-cells
It says you can use it to open Jupyter notebooks in Emacs.
Haven't looked at it yet.
20:33
Will check it out

20:35
Jeff Trull
Well this is my second Emacs meetup today so I think I'll sign off ðŸ˜ƒ
Thanks Mike for organizing
20:35
Sacha Chua
Thanks for hosting! =)
