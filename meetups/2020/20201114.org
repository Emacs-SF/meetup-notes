#+TITLE: 2020-11-14 meetup

* MELPA and package management
* Emacs history and the 80s
** Gosling Emacs (1981)
   - (Unix, by *that* James Gosling)
** Epsilon (1984)
   - (DOS originally but astonishingly still sold - for $250 - and getting updates)
** at least two of us have 35 *years* Emacs experience
* gcc jit
** the global lock/lack of "real" multithreading may be a bigger issue for performance
*** side effects - why so much setq? This is not ideal functional programming.
*** dynamic binding performance impact - may require global lookup
** Edwin vs. Guile Emacs
* Young-Il poll: Does Emacs make us Luddites?
** Sean: yes, by definition :)
** Greg: but Luddites destroyed "labor saving machinery" which is what Emacs is
   - we need a new word
** Michael Winslow: InfoBlox has about 5% Emacs users
** Jeff: what drives the youngest Emacs users to start?
*** our newer members suggest packages, like org-mode, magit, and LSP
* crdt.el
** A new mode for collaborative editing using the eponymous algorithm
   - safe asynchronous editing with conflict avoidance
   - Author Qiantan Hong gave a demo at Emacs NYC 11/2
   - there is also a discussion on emacs-devel
** What is the use?
   - agile (Sean)?
* Anki?
** Greg wants to know if anyone uses it
   - Sean has used it
   - useful for learning languages
** It looks like there are some Emacs packages for this now, see for example [[https://yiufung.net/post/anki-org/][this post]]
* Sean talks about his thesis, now in progress at Argonne
** laminar flow of immiscible liquids
** Numerical methods and why physicists use obsolete ones from 70s textbooks
** IP issues in the very popular [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13512036][Numerical Recipes]], see [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13512036][hacker news]] for some of the debate
** Sean may add a feature to mu4e
* sachac and jwiegley appear
* Emacs keybindings in other tools
** Sean really wants scriptable UI
   - If he can use it from a CLI he can script it
   - like [[https://www.hammerspoon.org/][Hammerspoon]]
** Sacha points out [[https://github.com/autokey/autokey][autokey]] (Linux/X11 only)
** scripting browser
* Tiling window managers
** Ethan uses [[https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm][bspwm]]
** elessar likes [[https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst][amethyst]] (MacOS, based on xmonad)
** Prashant Tak mentions [[http://stumpwm.github.io/][StumpWM]] (Common Lisp)
** and of course there's Emacs-based [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][EXWM]]
* Funny packages (sachac)
** [[https://github.com/stardiviner/emacs-rainbow-fart][Rainbow Fart Mode]] - (Chinese slang) compliments you excessively while you type
** [[https://github.com/oitofelix/cpu-sos][cpu-sos]] - suspend processes in hidden buffers
* Beautification
** Ethan: Doom themes are great
** jwiegley: [[https://github.com/rolandwalker/unicode-fonts][different fonts/sizes for different Unicode pages]]
   - e.g. you could make math particularly large
** sachac:

*** [[https://github.com/rougier/elegant-emacs][A very minimal but elegant Emacs]]
*** [[https://www.typetasting.com/portfolio][Type Tasting]] - Sarah Hyndman's site
* Repos of dot files
** [[https://github.com/JosephFerano/dotfiles][Joseph Ferano]]
** [[https://github.com/brongulus/.doom.d][Prashant Tak]]
** [[https://gitlab.com/ethancedwards/emacs-config/-/blob/master/README.org][Ethan]]
*** keeps his in git as recommended [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dotfiles#Tracking_dotfiles_directly_with_Git][here]] and [[https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles][here]]
** [[https://github.com/jwiegley/dot-emacs][jwiegley]]
* Sean to jwiegley re: developing his privacy blocker
** The technical challenge is to modify xwidget-webkit to enable an [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]] feature on Macs
*** the patch adds a [[https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/creating_a_content_blocker][content blocking]] API
** could theoretically allow adblocking from ELisp
** the work is in [[https://github.com/seanfarley/emacs][a fork]]
* Working in C
** jwiegley has never touched the C source in Emacs
** Sean: [[https://github.com/etaoins/arret][ArrÃªt]] is a strongly-typed Lisp written in Rust
*** one alternative: [[http://blog.veitheller.de/Carp.html][Carp]], a compiled Lisp without garbage collection but with a Rust-like borrow checker
** Someone made a binding system for [[https://github.com/ubolonton/emacs-module-rs/][making Emacs modules in Rust]]
   - used to make bindings for [[https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2018/tree-sitter---a-new-parsing-system-for-programming-tools.html][tree-sitter]], a parsing framework designed for editors
* RMS policy is to never have Emacs on Linux be less featureful than proprietary platforms
** [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13011185][hacker news on the controversy]]
