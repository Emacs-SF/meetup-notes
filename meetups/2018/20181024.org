* C++ in Emacs
** BoF at CppCon

** IDE assist
- C++ is hard to parse (and slow) interactively. Needs help.
- Tags
  - Relies on index that must be regenerated on changes
- compiler server
  - put smarts into separate process
*** Alternatives
- LSP based
  - clangd
  - cquery
  - ccls
    - a fork of cquery!
- custom protocol
  - rtags
    - an indexer, but uses Clang to do it
  - ycmd
*** My preference: lsp-mode with clangd
- lsp-clangd is a light wrapper around ~lsp-define-stdio-client~, may work for you
  - I need a slightly more complicated setup
- cquery has possibilities
  - like clangd based on clang but own lsp etc. implementation
  - looks like it is a drop-in replacement for clangd
  - Jennifer Wilcox presentatation at CppCon

- [[https://github.com/Emacs-SF/meetup-notes/blob/master/meetups/20180728.org][more specifics on my setup from prior meetup]]
- The above notwithstanding I think we need to do a shootout!
