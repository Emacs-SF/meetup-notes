*** config for company/helm completion
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package company
  :config
  (setq company-idle-delay nil)    ;; disable "idle" completion (when you pause)
  :hook                            ;; which uses the standard company mode UI
  ((c++-mode . company-mode)))
  
;; Using the helm narrowing style because it's more familiar
;; interestingly this is not a company "front end" but something else
(use-package helm-company
  :after company
  :bind (:map company-mode-map     ;; suggestions from helm-company docs
         ("C-:" . helm-company)    ;; we'll manually activate help completion
         :map company-active-map
         ("C-:" . helm-company)))

;; use LSP as code completion server

#+END_SRC
*** general discussion
- LSP is a protocol from Microsoft
- clangd is the magic ingredient, implements the protocol using the Clang compiler
- You need a compilation database (json with build recipes)
- he disables automatic completion in favor of a key binding
- speed and resource usage very acceptable
