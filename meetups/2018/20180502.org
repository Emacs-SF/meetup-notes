- More venues are always good
- If you're an "event organizer" you can create any meeting you like
  - Emacs and Clojure?
  - Meetings in South/East/North Bay?
  - More convenient times?

** Introduction
- Harry does a lot of arithmetic at work
- Today we will all stop opening terminals to calculate numbers
** Calc
*** Overview
- An RPN-based calculator
- M-x calc
- online docs at https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/calc.html
*** Basic usage
- type numbers to add them onto the stack
- type operators (+-*/^) to perform the operation and replace the top of the stack with it
- need to quote minus sign to enter negative. Use single quote
- capital U to undo
- TAB rotates top 2 numbers on stack
- M-TAB rotates the top 3
- Harry notes you can do arbitrary manipulations with those two alone
- ?hh for help
*** Vectors
- Used for numeric vectors but also things like sets
- can do inner and outer products, LU decomposition

*** Algebra
- The same single quote that introduced negative numbers introduces algebra
- macsyma format
- many commands introduced by "a" to do manipulations
  - expansion, factoring, substitutions (with parens introduced where needed)

*** Integration with External Tools
- gnuplot
  - [-10..10] inclusive range
  - x^2
  - "gf" will now graph x^2 over the range
  - you can also do range intersections (attempted live!)
  - "gn" chooses number of points to plot
  - "gF" does a 3D plot!

*** Other things that came up
- there is a macro called defmath you can define your own calc functions with
- "screenkey" was the tool used to display keys being pressed: https://github.com/wavexx/screenkey
- Harry couldn't find the info files for calc; it turns out they are in a separate package ("emacs25-common-non-dfsg") on Debian (and thus Ubuntu), for license reasons.

** Post-Presentation Discussion
We veered off pretty far, into math and category theory
*** Mike's notes:
**** Category theory

**** Intuitionistic logic
sometimes more generally called constructive logic
