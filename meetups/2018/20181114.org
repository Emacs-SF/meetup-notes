** Building a Second Brain in Emacs and Org-Mode
** Hi, I'm Tasshin
- MAPLE, OAK, W/L/P
- Would love to talk with people more about this after the talk, at a later date
** [[https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com][BASB]]
Disclosure: I work with Tiago and Forte Labs
** Before
Before: Many emacs org files (20? 30?), some empty or just placeholders, headers under headers under headers, many long lines of files, emacs functions taking noticeably / prohibitively long time to run (e.g. search, refile- some people can’t even use these)
** After
After: One main task file, a few auxiliary files with specific purposes, ~4000 notes in Evernote and other locations (Dropbox, Google Drive), filed neatly
** Pros and Cons of Minimal/Maximal approaches
** PARA
A lot of this talk will focus in particular on PARA which stands for Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives. It is a universal system for organizing digital information: both tasks and reference

Projects: Complete app mockup; Develop project plan; Execute business development campaign; Write blog post; Finalize product specifications; Attend conference

Areas: Health; Finances, Professional Development; Travel; Hobbies; Friends; Apartment; Car; Productivity; Direct reports; Product Development; Writing

Resources: habit formation; project management; transhumanism; coffee; music; gardening; online marketing; SEO; interior design; architecture; note-taking

Archives: projects that have been completed or become inactive; areas that you are no longer committed to maintaining; resources that you are no longer interested in

No resources in task manager
** Demos

Most people have the first one
** Files I have
- inbox.org: entry point, from laptop (capture templates) and mobile (Beorg, via Dropbox)
- todo.org: tasks, filed in Projects or Areas
- somedaymaybe.org: tracking SOMEDAY / MAYBE tasks
- agendas.org: lists of items to discuss with specific people when I see them next
- goals.org: tracking long-term goals, which Tasks, Projects, and Areas move towards.
** Project / Area Overview
Project-overview
Area-overview
Uses column view
** Stuck Projects
** Regular Reviews
Procedures, processes
Cynefin: Complicated domain
** Template Expansion
Capture templates can be based in files

Key ones I use:
%^{prompt
%^{prop}p, prompt for a value for property prop
%t, Timestamp, date only
%u inactive timestamps
** Important Packages
[[https://github.com/kidd/org-gcal.el][org-gcal]] (new maintainers!): self-explanatory
[[https://github.com/rexim/org-cliplink][org-cliplink]]: insert org-mode links from clipboard
[[https://github.com/jkitchin/ox-clip][ox-clip]]: copy formatted content out of Org-Mode and into other programs
[[https://github.com/mwfogleman/org-randomnote][org-randomnote]]: by yours truly, implements the RandomNote idea in Emacs Org-Mode

* Organizer Notes
After the presentation ended we talked about many things; I recall in particular two related to capture:
- John Wiegley uses [[https://getdrafts.com/][Drafts]] on his watch to capture new org items and sync them via iCloud to his main system.
- There is some excitement around a new app called [[https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/84xyg8/building_an_org_modecompatible_web_app_with/][Neat Draft]]
- Abhishek mentioned Rainer König has [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVtKhBrRV_ZkPnBtt_TD1Cs9PJlU0IIdE][a great series of org-mode videos]], each fairly digestible.
