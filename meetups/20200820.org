* Rough Transcript
** Some discussion of whether jitsi screen share works with various browsers
- consensus seems to be Firefox works, Safari does not
** Ligatures
- a popular feature. jwiegley likes prettify-symbols-mode, though see Emacs 27 for new approach
  - his config for Haskell is  https://github.com/jwiegley/dot-emacs/blob/master/init.el#L1989
  - he uses DejaVu Sans Mono (as does your organizer): https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/
** Emacs 27 features
  - Harfbuzz for font rendering (supports ligatures among other things)
  - jwiegley passes on the following feature list:
    - Built-in support for arbitrary-size integers
    - Text shaping with HarfBuzz
    - Native support for JSON parsing
    - Better support for Cairo drawing
    - Portable dumping used instead of unexec
    - Support for XDG conventions for init files
    - Additional early-init initialization file
    - Lexical-binding is used by default
    - Built-in support for tab bar and tab-line
    - Support for resizing and rotating of images without ImageMagick
  - also see [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/whats-new-in-emacs-27-1][an annotated feature list from the author of Mastering Emacs]]
** gccemacs
  - [[https://akrl.sdf.org/gccemacs.html][native compilation of emacs lisp]] is moving along at a rapid clip
    - several attendees have used and enjoyed
  - for MacOS users [[http://xenodium.com/trying-out-gccemacs-on-macos/][this blog post]] has proven useful
** grip-mode
  - [[https://github.com/seagle0128/grip-mode][a previewer for Github-flavored Markdown]]
** org-roam
  - An implementation of some of the ideas behind [[https://roamresearch.com/][Roam]] in Emacs
  - a sort of graph-structured note-taking tool
  - Ag suggests a couple of videos:
    - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_7_8AAkV7M][Beginner's Guide to Roam Research]]
    - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGRCDm1H4IQ][Roam Research in Emacs (Zetteldeft Comparison)]]
** organice
  - This is a browser-based implementation of org-mode (no Emacs)
  - https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice
  - (suggestion from Brian Wood)
** emacs-tree-sitter
  - [[https://github.com/ubolonton/emacs-tree-sitter/][Emacs bindings (via Rust) to the tree-sitter incremental parsing framework]]
  - intended to improve language features in Emacs
  - some good discussion [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/dqcbtp/a_few_comments_on_treesitter_for_emacs_via_rust/][on Reddit]]
** Emacs clients for chat apps
  - some discussion re: how unfriendly Slack and Discord can be to non-native clients
  - Telegram client recommended (or good old IRC)
** Helm vs Ivy
  - most of us are Ivy users, one or two (including your organizer) use Helm
  - There is a new selection framework called [[https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum][Selectrum]]
** Emacs on MacOS
  - many of us are using it successfully
  - Davide Restivo (not present) is maintaining a Homebrew recipe [[https://github.com/daviderestivo/homebrew-emacs-head][here]]
  - We had a sidebar on [[http://www.hammerspoon.org/][Hammerspoon]], a system control tool/scripting for Macs
    - A good post by Alvaro Ramirez () is [[http://xenodium.com/emacs-utilities-for-your-os/][here]]
    - Our very own Ag Ibragimov created a set of Lisp (not Elisp!) bindings reminiscent of Spacemacs [[https://github.com/agzam/spacehammer][here]]
    - Linux may in theory be able to support something like this but you'd need a window manager that exposed the right APIs
