** Pre-emacs config
 MacOS specific (sorry); please let me
 know the equivalents for linux!

 Must haves mapped keys:
 - caps lock -> control
 - shift -> opt / alt
 - fn -> hyper

** Old config:
 First version was =init.el=

** Old config:
 First version was =init.el=
 which became randomly scattered

** Old config (second version):
 Started with 2396 lines...

** Old config (second version):
 Grew to over 10k!

** Old config (second version):
 This was a problem for many reasons:

 - quickly became unmanageable
 - most of the code bitrot
 - random settings I
   wasn't sure even
   applied anymore

** Enter doom
 There are many alternatives:

 - spacemacs
 - prelude
 - centaur
 - etc

** Choose one that fits with you

 And takes the burden off from understanding all those thousands of
 tuning knobs

** Demo time
 - ivy / ivy-posframe
 - email
 - chat
 - modeline
 - emacsclient + tramp
 - pdf-tools
 - passwords
