#+TITLE: Elisp Hacking Night: Org-Mode

* Logistics
- We are hybrid tonight, for the first time in a couple of years, with an unknown number of remote participants.
  It's gonna get /crazy/. Please be patient.
- In person:
  - bathroom key to right of office entrance
  - I need a volunteer to let in latecomers
  - Speakers and microphones off on personal laptops, except (maybe) for the presenter
- Remote:
  - Please mute yourself unless you are speaking. I anticipate mysterious feedback we will need to track down.
  - If you have headphones please use them
  - How we will handle the multiple microphones vs. people's individual laptops is TBD
  - BBB (Big Blue Button) experts please identify yourselves in the chat

* News
** New Emacs version 29.3
- Emergency security release
- locking down evaluating things (arbitrary lisp in Org files, LaTeX preview, MIME content in Gnus) when loaded
  - org-mode is affected
** New Elisp video
- Gavin Freeborn, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1y__2IK-aLM][Learn Emacs Lisp in 30 Minutes]]. An intro for people who know other Lisps.
- Positronics, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8391afYiRs][Elisp Idiosyncracies]]
** Streamers
- System Crafters, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6hMwJfaXV8][Code Dive: Project.el in in Emacs]]. Goes into how it works at the ELisp level.
- LCOLONQ, on [[https://www.twitch.tv/lcolonq][Twitch]] Tuesdays and Fridays, I don't know what coffee he is drinking but it's strong. Fun.

* Presentations

*** Discussion
- Someone mentioned [[https://github.com/stuartsierra/org-mode/blob/master/contrib/lisp/orgtbl-sqlinsert.el][orgtbl-to-sqlinsert]] as an alternative
- There's also Jonas Bernoulli's [[https://github.com/magit/emacsql][emacsql]]

** Jeff Trull: org-mode exporters
# memo to self: C-x n s org-narrow-to-subtree
*** Learning
I'm giving only the briefest of introductions because there are great resources out there -
e.g. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/swvbmm/you_want_to_write_a_custom_org_backend_lets_write/][Tony Aldon's Reddit post]] on the subject. Instead, I'm going to quickly skim the code
of one particular exporter and note some interesting parts.
*** ox-gfm
- An exporter for "Github Flavored Markdown"
- There is an actual Markdown spec but many nonstandard extensions have been created. This is one of the most popular.
- Extra features: code highlighting via source blocks, strike-through, better tables
  - mostly these seem to simply replace HTML with corresponding GFM structures that aren't in plain MD.
*** Derived Exporters
- ~org-export-define-derived-backend~ saves time for backends that are largely the same as an existing one
- "like X, except for the following parts of the org file"
- ~gfm~ inherits from ~md~ which inherits from ~html~
- ~gfm~ overrides 8 transcoders of ~md~
*** org-element
- Exporter transcoders are supplied with AST nodes you can interrogate with ~org-element-*~ functions
- Look at ~org-gfm-src-block~ and ~org-gfm-strike-through~
- helpful for understanding exporter behavior:

#+begin_src elisp :results none
(pp-eval-expression '(org-element-parse-buffer)) ; in any org buffer
#+end_src

- run ~~ in an org buffer to see AST
  - very helpful for understanding exporter behavior
*** Discussion
- Charles: there is a [[https://github.com/titaniumbones/ox-slack/blob/master/ox-slack.el][Slack exporter]] based on =ox-gfm=, would be nice to insert the result into Slack window
- Radon suggests the [[https://github.com/alpha22jp/atomic-chrome][Emacs fork of Atomic Chrome]] for this purpose

** Jeff Trull: an exporter for Keynote
*** Motivation
- Beamer output viewed as unprofessional (at least with the themes I chose)
- Corporate presentation standards
- Reentering text is tedious and unproductive
*** Design Considerationss
**** Translate things into features of equal power
- plots in Org become plots in Keynote (not images of gnuplot output)
- table formulas translated faithfully where possible (vs. copying cell contents)
- Inline LaTeX becomes Keynote "formula" (not image)
**** Keynote format changes frequently and RE is incomplete
- Solution: generate Applescript, then run it, like we do with LaTeX
**** Applescript API is stable but incomplete
- Solution: script UI actions
  - yes, it's fragile
**** Which slide template to use?
- Need mechanism for users to specify defaults, override per-slide
- Need "smart" approach for when unspecified
- Which "text item" (box) should we use?
- What if we run out of space?
- Side-by-side layout?

I am still feeling my way through many issues.
