* Jeff Trull: Unit testing with ERT and el-mock
** ert basic usage
#+begin_src elisp
  (defun jet-stupid-mul (a b)
          42)

  (ert-deftest mul-test ()
    "Basic usage"
    (should (= 42 (jet-stupid-mul 6 7))))  ;; it works!

  (ert-deftest mul-test-2 ()
    "Advanced usage"
    (should (= 36 (jet-stupid-mul 6 6))))  ;; oops
#+end_src
** mocks
#+begin_src elisp
  (require 'el-mock)

  (defun jet-today ()
      (substring (current-time-string) 0 3))

  (ert-deftest today-basic ()
    "Simple usage of jet-today"
    (should (string= "Thu" (jet-today))))    ;; fragile

  (ert-deftest today-improved ()
    "Simple usage of jet-today"
    (with-mock
      (stub current-time-string => "Fri Nov  1 15:59:49 2019")
      (should (string= "Fri" (jet-today)))))
