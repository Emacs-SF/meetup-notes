*** History
In the early 80s no one knew what kind of software to write for the new wave of
personal computers. There were all kinds of bad ideas, like recipe software.
(it's for the home, right?). One source of ideas was "whatever runs on a mainframe,
but a weaker version". You can blame this on ex CS grad students. Anyway
"Emacs clone" was pretty popular. Epsilon was one of those, written partly at
CMU and free to all students.

- See also MicroEMACS, from 1985. Linus Torvalds was still using his own fork
  of it as of 2018

*** Features (1985 version 2.01)
**** Very small
- 80KB
**** Most features (and many default keybindings) we would recognize
- multiple "windows" and buffers
- keyboard macros
- shell
- self-documenting: describe-key, describe-command
**** Limited programming model
- "commands" are builtin and have up to two string arguments
- you can name keyboard macros, but they don't take arguments
- bind-key
- you can run named commands or macros with M-x ("A-x")
- you can save macro definitions to a file and load it in later
  - I have not been able to get this to work
**** Early updates
- concurrent process buffer (January 1985) allowed simultaneous edit+compile
- EEL (proper Lisp-like extension language) in October 1985

*** A sample of the manual
- Thanks to Steven Doerfler of Lugaru Software

*** Modern Epsilon
- On version 14
- $250 from the Lugaru Software website

*** Demo
- basic navigation
- defining a keyboard macro, naming it, and saving it to a file
- We discovered that "dired" existed!
