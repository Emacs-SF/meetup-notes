** About Me
- I’m from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada
- I did my undergraduate degree at the University of Alberta
  - I started out my software career/education as a Vim user
  - Lots of C, Python, and a little bit of Ruby during school
- The org-mode plugin for Vim was nice for writing documentation
- I am not good at remembering my TODOs
  - I tried many different software systems (Apple Notes/Reminders, Google Keep,
    ect.) but I could never get one to stick
- I didn’t have a good system in place for organizing tasks or knowledge
- This lead me to org-mode
- I’ve been using Emacs daily for the last ~1.5 years
- Currently I am Back-end Software Engineer work at Turo, a Peer-to-Peer car sharing platform
** My Emacs Setup
- [[https://develop.spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]]
  - Develop branch is heavily recommended
  - Installs easily
  - Easy to configure, low learning curve (for Emacs), virtually no
    configuration needed to get started
  - GNU Emacs 26.3 (build 1, x86_64-apple-darwin18.5.0, NS appkit-1671.40
    Version 10.14.4 (Build 18E226)) of 2019-08-30
- Ivy
- Org mode version 9.3.2
- https://github.com/mack1070101/dotfiles/blob/master/.spacemacs
  - All my config files can be found in this repo
** Restclient
- [[https://github.com/pashky/restclient.el][Restclient]] is a Domain Specific Language (DSL)
  - “A programming language designed for a specific application domain”
  - In plain english: a language to do one thing really well
  - Famous examples: Dot, PlantUML, Gradle, HTML, ect.
- Org mode support for Restclient: [[https://github.com/alf/ob-restclient.el/blob/master/ob-restclient.el][ob-restclient]]
- You can replace Restclient with any programming language that supports network
  calls and has a package for org-mode
- Analogous tools: Postman, cURL, ect.
** On to the Good Stuff
The example document and a small server program can be found here

** How I use Org Mode
- I use my own sloppy variant of GTD
  - Tasks are dumped into an Inbox.org, then moved to their respective homes with ~org-refile~
  - ~org-capture~ gets used heavily
  - I manage my day/tasks out of ~org-agenda~ + tagged TODO lists
- I try to move everything into a handful of files (as opposed to many files)
  because managing things with tags is easier
- Archiving headings is great, but I try not to
- ~org-add-note~ is good to capture quick notes for a heading
- ~counsel-jump-in-buffer~ is a great way to move around

** Org Mode - Tips and Tricks
- Restclient has a bug for Spacemacs/develop
  - You can hack around this by using ~org-babel-after-execute-hook~ (see my
    .spacemacs file)
- [[https://beorgapp.com/][Beorg]] for iOS is awesome, because I can dump tasks into my Inbox.org file while I’m on the go
  - Bidirectional sync with computers via iCloud, Box, Dropbox, and WebDAV
  - This was really the missing piece that has allowed org-mode to consume my life
  - Basically I just use it as “capture” device
- ~kill-emacs-hook~: take actions on “shutdown” of Emacs

** Other Emacs Stuff
- [[https://github.com/mack1070101/fotingo-emacs][fotingo-emacs]]: my first Emacs package
  - Very much a work in progress
  - A wrapper for an open source tool ([[https://github.com/tagoro9/fotingo][fotingo]]) for automating interactions with
    Jira and Github made by another Turo engineer
  - Aims to integrate well with magit via transient
  - I’d like to get to a point where it’s full functionality has been implemented in Emacs
- Magit is amazing
- [[https://github.com/dajva/rg.el][rg.el]] is also great for searching for stuff
